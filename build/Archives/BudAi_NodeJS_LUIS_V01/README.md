## Requirements and Gathering

1. [Microsoft Azure Bot Framework Composer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/):

   ​	Bot Framework Composer, built on the Bot Framework SDK, is an open-source IDE for developers to author, test, provision, and manage conversational experiences. It provides a powerful visual authoring canvas enabling [dialogs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/concept-dialog), [language-understanding models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/concept-language-understanding), [QnAMaker Knowledge bases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/how-to-add-qna-to-bot), and [language generation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/concept-language-generation) responses to be authored from within one canvas and crucially, enables these experiences to be extended with code for more complex tasks such as system integration. Resulting experiences can then be tested within Composer and provisioned into Azure along with any dependent resources.

   Composer is available as [a desktop application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/install-composer) for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Once you download it, you can open the application first and create a empty bot project.
