# Bud.ai – Microsoft Internship Project

## Project Title : 
Bud.ai – The Student Twin

## Project Statement/Opportunity : 

The education sector in India has been undergoing massive transformations, with pandemics causing shocks to the system, institutions being forced to close, and students transitioning to online learning. Due to school and college closures, approximately 250 million students were impacted. CoVID-19 also acted as a catalyst for digital adoption in educational institutions, forcing them to implement a remote learning solution as soon as possible. However, quick fixes aren't always feasible or student-friendly. Zoom, for example, has caused upheaval in the video-meeting space but does not provide an in-out learning ecosystem. This is where integrating academic solutions that assist students in managing academics on a single platform becomes pivotal. Microsoft Teams enables the integration of custom learning management solutions, resulting in effective learning. Our goal is to create a bot solution that allows students to manage their academics in a single platform, such as Microsoft Teams, with no extra effort.

	
## Project Description :

The impact of the CoVID-19 Pandemic on education is both unprecedented and widespread in education history, impacting every student in the world. The unexpected arrival of pandemic and subsequent school closures saw massive efforts and more technical implementations to the education system to deliver continued education around the world. These changes were made very quickly as the prevailing circumstances demanded. Overnight, many schools and education systems began to offer education remotely. Through television, the internet and every other medium that reached the masses. Regardless of the outcomes, remote learning through video meetings has become the de-facto method of delivering education for more than a year now. However, the remote education through video meetings also has its downsides. The students in one hand are advised to attend online meetings at one space, and access the educational resources somewhere else on the other hand. This cluttered, unfriendly learning ecosystem can be coped up by senior students but junior students feel it’s too difficult for them to navigate to different platforms to access different tasks and it also causes digital divide. This is where merging the gap and unifying the learning ecosystem becomes the need of the hour.
